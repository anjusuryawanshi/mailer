## Summary

A RESTful API for sending emails written in Ruby on Rails.

## API Introduction

This API sends an email when a user sends a `POST` request with `JSON` content. The request will contain `to`, `subject`, and `body` of the email message to be sent. This request is then transformed into a model called `smail` and an email message is generated and sent to the reciepient mentioned in the request.

### Send email (POST)

Here is a sample POST request payload:

``` json
{
  "mail": {
    "to": "anjali.1585@gmail.com",
    "subject": "Do not reply - test",
    "body": "This is a test message"
  }
}
```

Send the above payload in a POST request. The above request generates an email that looks as below:
